# JS-NotesCode
This repository is a collection of small, focused JavaScript exercises I built while practicing core concepts. Each folder contains a separate mini-project or code snippet targeting one specific feature of JS. None of this is meant to be “production-ready” — it’s strictly hands-on learning to sharpen fundamentals.

📂 Folder Overview

AsyncAndAwait – Experiments with async functions, promises, and handling asynchronous operations cleanly.

EventListener – Basic event-handling examples using DOM events.

Fun.Obj.Methods – Practice with functions, objects, object methods, and how this behaves.

TakeInput – Simple DOM input handling and updating UI with user-provided values.

agechecker – A basic age validation/use-case to practice conditional logic and input handling.

calculateParameter – Small utility focused on parameter calculations and basic maths in JS.

checkedproperty – Playing around with checkbox states and DOM properties.

randomNumber – Random number generation and related logic.

tempConvertor – Temperature conversion logic (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit, etc.).

🎯 Purpose of This Repo

I created this repo to practice JavaScript fundamentals the right way — by actually coding them out instead of passively reading tutorials. Each folder tackles one concept in isolation so I can revisit and revise easily.

The goal isn’t to build big projects; it’s to build confidence with the basics that real applications rely on.

⚙️ Tech Used

JavaScript (ES6+)

HTML/CSS (where needed for DOM examples)
